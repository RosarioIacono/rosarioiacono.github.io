>“It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth.
>I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.
>I didn’t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.”

– Neil Armstrong, Astronaut

Everything began when we started looking Earth from the sky. On July 13, 1972 Landsat 1, then known  as Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) was sent by NASA to orbit around our planet. It was the first Earth-observing satellite to be launched with the express intent to study and monitor our planet’s landmasses.

And if you were to be Landsat1, some things would strike your attention once you were up there:
1. You are not afraid of heights, although this feature was never tested by NASA
2. You feel quite lonely
3. The earth looks quite small seen from there

What is more you would look down to earth and see it quite differently.
